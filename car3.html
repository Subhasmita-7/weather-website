            The national capital was conspicuous by not recording any cold days or cold waves, this season in December. The jinx was broken and the first cold day of the season was observed on 04th Jan 2024. The minimum temperature plunged to 7.7°C and the day got arrested at 12.5°C, the lowest of this season so far. This was followed by yet another cold day, the next day itself, albeit there was a marginal rise of mercury, both during day and night. Subsequently, the day temperature stayed close to the normal of 17-18°C, and therefore eluding the cold day conditions.<br><br>

For announcing a ‘cold day’, the minimum temperature needs to be under 10°C and the maximum temperature below 16°C with a departure of at least 4.5°C or more from the normal.  These criteria were met yet again yesterday when the minimum temperature in the morning was 7.9°C and the day mercury plummeted to 13.4°C, a massive 6°C below the normal. The meteorological office at Lodhi Road was further lower by a few notches by registering a minimum of 6.4°C, about 8°C below the average.  Conditions are not looking any better today, and successive cold days may go on record. The minimum temperature today, as such, is a shade lower than yesterday at 7.1°C.<br><br>

There has been no thick fog appearing in the morning over the Delhi/NCR region for the last couple of days. However, the lifted fog has obscured the lower layers of the atmosphere. It has blocked the sunshine and arrested the rise in temperature. In addition, there was a cloud cover as well, yesterday which has lifted today. Shallow fog and a light cold breeze with humid conditions will raise the chill factor.  The day temperature is unlikely to lift and is expected to be significantly below the normal.<br><br>

A weak western disturbance is approaching the northern mountains between the 12th and 13th Jan and is closely followed by a similar system on 16th and 17th Jan. The persistence of these two weather systems may break the chain of cold days, as the day temperature will rise to about 17-18°C, till midweek next. The minimum temperature will hover around 7-8°C. Cold wave, as such is not expected for Delhi and the cold day conditions may also abate. However, the nip in the air will remain and the biting cold sensation will be felt during early morning and late night hours.</div>
