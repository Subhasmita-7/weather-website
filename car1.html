        <div class="m">
            The financial capital, Mumbai was sprayed with light rain and drizzle in some parts of the city.  The weather activity started early last night and lasted for a couple of hours only. The airport observatory at Santacruz recorded 1mm of rainfall, whereas the regional observatory at Colaba skipped the stray showers.  Earlier, the cloud cover during the day restricted the rise of temperature to hang around the normal of 32°C.  However, the minimum temperature took a sharp rise to clock 22°C, about 5°C above the normal.<br><br>
These rains were an offshoot of a trough extending from the cyclonic circulation over down south in the equatorial region. This north-south feature resulted in moderate rains all along Kerala and Coastal Karnataka as well.  However, these were very light along the Goa and Konkan Coast.  Light rains spilled over to the lee side of the Western Ghats also, to cover the Madhya Maharashtra region. The circulation has now moved westward and the associated trough is also somewhat diffused.<br><br>
<br><br>
The remnant of the trough is likely to cause a cloudy sky over Mumbai, today as well.  The chances of any further rains are shrinking.  Tomorrow onward, a fair amount of sunshine, raising the day temperature by 2-3°C is quite likely.  Increased humidity and increasing mercury may lead to a warm afternoon.  Sea breeze could be a soothing factor in the evening and early night hours. Mumbaikars can expect warm day temperatures of 33-34°C and the minimum in the morning may take a slight dip to hover around 19-20°C.
